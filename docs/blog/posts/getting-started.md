## Introduction

Modern web development has evolved dramatically over the past few years. With new frameworks, tools, and best practices emerging constantly, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. This guide will help you navigate the landscape and set you on the path to success.

## Essential Technologies

### 1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The foundation of web development remains unchanged. Master these three pillars:

- **HTML** for structure and semantics
- **CSS** for styling and layout (including modern features like Grid and Flexbox)
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic content

git push origin main
```

### 3. Modern Frameworks

Consider learning one or more of these popular frameworks:

- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **Vue.js** - Progressive framework
- **Angular** - Full-featured framework
- **Svelte** - Compiler-based approach

## Best Practices

### Responsive Design

Always design for mobile first, then scale up:

```css
/* Mobile first */
.container {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 1rem;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 720px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```

### Accessibility

Make your websites accessible to everyone:

- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure proper color contrast
- Support keyboard navigation
- Use ARIA labels when needed

### Performance

Optimize your websites for speed:

- Minimize HTTP requests
